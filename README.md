# Forgery-localization-for-remote-sensing

🔥 Congradualations! This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing! It is my second TGRS. Hope I can achieve a ISPRS in the near future!

The code for FLDCF: A Collaborative Framework for Forgery Localization and Detection in Satellite Imagery.

# Data preprocessing 🔨

Our datasets could be obtained from [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ugHYZEfaoGLHosa8whbGiA) code：been (./data)


Put it into ./data and rename them as fakeV and fakeL.

# Training and testing 🚆

* Train

1. Train content-based prior

option1: Trained by yourself. Put the final pretrain model into ./model and named it as model_lo.pt and model_vi.pt (for fakeL and fakeV)

```
python src/main.py --data_train Vaihingen --data_train_dir fakeV --model restore
```
I take fakeV as example. It could be changed to --data_train LoveDA --data_train_dir fakeV.

option2: Download the pretrain model from [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ugHYZEfaoGLHosa8whbGiA) code：been (./pretrain/prior) and put it into ./model

2. Train FLDCF

```
python src/main.py --data_train Vaihingen --data_train_dir fakeV --model fldcf
```

* Inference

```
python src/test.py --data_train Vaihingen --data_train_dir fakeV --model fldcf --pre_train model_fakeV.pt
```

The pretrain


# Trained checkpoints 💾

Our pretrain model could be obtained from [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ugHYZEfaoGLHosa8whbGiA) code：been (./pretrain/prior) (./pretrain/fldcf)
